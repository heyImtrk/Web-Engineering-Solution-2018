# 3(c). how to mitigate risks while develope web application?
__Ans:__  
- prototyping (avoid IKIWISI).  
- show changes to customer iteratively.  
- integrate existing systems sooner than later.

---

# 4(a). Why modeling is important in web application?
__Ans:__  
-reduce complexity  
-document design decisions  
-facilitate communication among team members  

Without data model and diagrams it is hard to fix and focus on the target scope of the development; the scope is often changing during development which result delay and not calculated costs of risk and effort.

With “modeling” we draw, represent and describe what we want to implement and we can talk about a fix and more compact package of web design during development.

# 4(c). Advantages of using UML as tool:
__Ans:__  
__Visual Representation:__   
A UML diagram is a visual representation of the relationships between classes and entities in a computer program. By showing information in a diagram, it is easy to understand and visualize a program's relationships.

__Readability and Re-usability:__  
A UML diagram is beneficial in that it is very readable. The diagram is meant to be understood by any type of programmer and helps to explain relationships in a program in a straightforward manner. 

__Standard:__  
UML is the current standard for programming in object-oriented programming languages. It is widely understood and well known. 

__Planning Tool:__  
UML helps to plan a program before the programming takes place. UML model diagram is easy to change, whereas reprogramming a section of code can be tedious and time-consuming.
